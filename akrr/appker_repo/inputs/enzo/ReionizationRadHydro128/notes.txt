InlineHaloFinder was disabled as it do seg.fault on large core counts



This is a cosmology simulation that simulates reionization using the 
ray tracing radiation transfer method with radiating star particles
and a Haardt & Madau background.  It will run on 2 processors in about
40 minutes.

Usage:
./inits.exe -d ReionizationRadHydro.inits
mpirun -np 2 ./ring.exe pv ParticlePositions ParticleVelocities
mpirun -np 2 ./enzo.exe -d ReionizationRadHydro.enzo
